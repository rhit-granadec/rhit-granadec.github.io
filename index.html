    <p>Hello! I am Elijah Granade, but you can call me Eli. I am an up and coming computer science major, currently enrolled at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I am a member of the Improv, Board game, and Dungeons and Dragons clubs on campus. I'm currenly running a campaign for several of my friends on campus. Ask me about the setting sometime!</p>
    <p>This website serves as both my personal portfolio and my resume, cataloging projects i've worked on in both a more resume format, and in a more displayable format where applicable.</p>
    <p>The portfolio page talks mostly about my computer science projects, while my resume goes more in-depth overall on a variety of applicable skills that i've worked on over the years.</p>
